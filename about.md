Some of my hobbies include:
- (bass) guitar
- cooking
- weightlifting
- hiking
- seeking that feeling of "I have no idea what this is, but I love it!"

<!-- TODO uncomment when I have more completed videos to show -->
<!-- I also have a YouTube channel as an outlet for guitar nerdery. Transcribing music is one of the most rewarding feelings ever, and I've got several dozen guitar covers in the works. -->
