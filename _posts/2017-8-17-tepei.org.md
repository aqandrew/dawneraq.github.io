Writeup coming soon. For now, check out the site at [TEPEI.org](http://tepei.org)!

<!-- My distaste for PHP began my first semester freshman year, in Intro to IT and Web Science. Something about manipulating the DOM from the document itself just felt wrong, even before I learned that it could be done from JavaScript. (Never mind that a lot of the frontend work I'm into does exaclty that&mdash;that's a conversation for another time.)

When I was selected as House Computing chairman that Spring, I knew that one of my responsibilities was to keep the info (pictures, zeitgeist) on [TEPEI.org](http://tepei.org) up to date. As soon as I got the FTP creds and started to explore the page's source code, I was bewildered and put off by the existing site's visual design, use of WordPress, and mysterious, archaic CSS framework.

"Duh" mistakes are as satisfying to solve as they are frustrating to make. For example: Jekyll won't display posts or drafts if the post's date (either in the file's name or Front Matter) is in the future.

I was inspired to use a monospace font after seeing TEP's MIT (Xi) chapter's [website](http://tep.mit.edu/). It speaks a little more to our nerdy character&mdash;after all, four out of our nine brothers are computer science majors at the time of writing. -->
