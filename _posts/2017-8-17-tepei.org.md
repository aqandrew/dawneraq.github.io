I've found PHP awkward to use since first semester freshman year, in Intro to IT and Web Science. The documentation is difficult to understand. And some features of the language just don't seem to make sense. Arrow notation (`=>`) for associative arrays? Appending DOM elements as string literals? (I guess it [works in a pinch](/fly-of-despair) if you haven't learned any better.) [PHP simply boggles my mind.](https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/)

When I was selected as House Computing chairman the following Spring, I knew that one of my responsibilities was to keep the info (pictures, zeitgeist) on [TEPEI.org](http://tepei.org) up to date. As soon as I got the FTP creds and started to explore the page's source code, I was bewildered and put off by the existing site's tacky visual design, use of WordPress, and mysterious, archaic CSS framework.

For the new site, I opted to use Jekyll since it's an excellent solution for making small and modular static pages. As for the theme, [Trophy](https://github.com/thomasvaeth/trophy-jekyll) is unique and rather nice to look at.

The most important thing I (re)learned? "Duh" mistakes are as satisfying to solve as they are frustrating to make. For instance, Jekyll won't generate pages for posts or drafts if the post's date (either in the file's name or Front Matter) is in the future.

All that's left now is to populate the site with some more literature and pictures, perhaps optimize images for faster loading, and pass this knowledge on to the next House Computing chairman.
